# Solar System Explorer - TON Crypto Game

## Overview

A 3D interactive solar system exploration game built with React and Three.js, integrated with the TON blockchain. Players explore planets in sequential order, earning StarTokens (cryptocurrency rewards) for each discovery. The application features a fully rendered 3D solar system with realistic planetary orbits, educational facts about each planet, and blockchain wallet connectivity through TON Connect.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Problem:** Create an immersive 3D space experience with smooth interactions and educational content.

**Solution:** React Three Fiber (R3F) for declarative 3D rendering combined with Radix UI components for interface elements.

**Technical Stack:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)** - React renderer for Three.js enabling declarative 3D scene composition
- **React Three Drei (@react-three/drei)** - Helper utilities for 3D elements (Stars, OrbitControls, Line)
- **Vite** - Fast build tool with HMR for development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom theme extensions for space-themed UI

**Architecture Pattern:** Component-based with separation of concerns between 3D canvas logic and UI overlays.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- 3D scene runs in a full-viewport Canvas while UI elements overlay with `pointer-events-none/auto` for selective interaction
- Separate components for each celestial body (Sun, Planet) enabling independent animation loops
- Custom GLSL shader support through vite-plugin-glsl for potential visual effects

**Pros:**
- Declarative 3D code is more maintainable than imperative Three.js
- React's component model naturally fits the solar system hierarchy
- Good performance through React Three Fiber's reconciliation

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with 3D programming
- Bundle size is larger due to Three.js dependencies

### State Management

**Problem:** Manage game progression, planet discovery state, and wallet integration across components.

**Solution:** Zustand with middleware for different state domains.

**State Stores:**
1. **useSolarSystem** - Persisted game state (discoveries, tokens, wallet)
   - Uses `persist` middleware for localStorage persistence
   - Tracks discovered planets with timestamps and rewards
   - Enforces sequential planet discovery order
   
2. **useGame** - Transient game phase management
   - Uses `subscribeWithSelector` for fine-grained subscriptions
   - Controls ready/playing/ended states
   
3. **useAudio** - Audio system state
   - Manages background music and sound effects
   - Centralized mute toggle

**Rationale:** Zustand chosen over Redux for simpler API and smaller bundle size. Separate stores prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Alternatives Considered:** Context API (too much provider nesting), Redux (overly complex for this use case)

### Data Architecture

**Problem:** Store and retrieve planet information with educational facts and game parameters.

**Solution:** Typed data models with centralized configuration.

**Structure:**
```typescript
interface PlanetData {
  name: string;
  size: number;          // Visual size in 3D scene
  color: string;         // Planet color
  orbitRadius: number;   // Distance from sun
  orbitSpeed: number;    // Orbital animation speed
  rotationSpeed: number; // Planet rotation speed
  tokenReward: number;   // Cryptocurrency reward
  facts: {...}          // Educational information
}
```

**Location:** `/client/src/data/planets.ts` - Single source of truth for all planetary data

**Pros:**
- Easy to modify game parameters without touching component code
- TypeScript ensures data consistency
- Educational facts integrated with game mechanics

### Backend Architecture

**Problem:** Provide API endpoints for potential future features while serving the SPA.

**Solution:** Express.js server with separation between API routes and static file serving.

**Structure:**
- **Entry Point:** `server/index.ts` - Express app configuration with middleware
- **Routes:** `server/routes.ts` - Placeholder for RESTful API endpoints (currently minimal)
- **Storage:** `server/storage.ts` - Storage abstraction layer with in-memory implementation
- **Vite Integration:** `server/vite.ts` - Development server with HMR

**Pattern:** API-first design with `/api` prefix for all backend routes, allowing clean separation from frontend routes.

**Current State:** Minimal backend functionality as most game logic runs client-side. Storage interface prepared for future user authentication and leaderboard features.

**Pros:**
- Ready to scale with additional backend features
- Clean separation between development and production builds
- Storage interface abstraction allows easy database integration

### Database Schema

**Problem:** Persist user data for authentication and game progress.

**Solution:** Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect, though currently using in-memory storage.

**Schema (shared/schema.ts):**
```typescript
users {
  id: serial (primary key)
  username: text (unique, not null)
  password: text (not null)
}
```

**Rationale:** 
- Schema prepared for future user accounts
- Drizzle chosen for type-safe queries and easy migrations
- Zod integration for runtime validation

**Migration Path:** Currently using `MemStorage` class. To enable database:
1. Provision PostgreSQL database
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
4. Implement `DBStorage` class replacing `MemStorage`

**Future Schema Considerations:**
- User wallet addresses linked to accounts
- Planet discovery records with timestamps
- Leaderboard/achievement tables
